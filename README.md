1. Aim

To construct a simple Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand, observe, and verify the operational process of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
________________________________________
2. Problem Statement
   
The task is to build a simulated network consisting of personal computers and a switch. This network will be used to generate traffic (using the ping command) that initiates the ARP process. The primary objective is to capture and analyze the ARP request and reply mechanism to understand how IP addresses are mapped to physical MAC addresses within a local network.

3. Scope of the Solution

This project is confined to a simulated environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The scope includes:
•	Creating a single, flat LAN topology (one broadcast domain).
•	Statically assigning IPv4 addresses to end devices.
•	Using Simulation Mode to observe the packet flow for ARP and ICMP protocols.
•	Verifying the dynamic population of the ARP cache on a host machine.
The project does not cover routing, inter-VLAN communication, or ARP processes in more complex network architectures.
